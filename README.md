## How to Use This Repo

- **Browse by topic** using the table above.
- Many sections contain **markdown notes** and command snippets you can copy‑paste.
- Where applicable, folders contain subfolders for tools or subtopics (e.g., `Enumeration/nmap` for Nmap‑specific notes).

---

## Highlights

- 🧭 **Enumeration basics → tooling deep dives** (e.g., Nmap use cases, scan recipes).
- 🐧 **Linux** fundamentals, shell tips, and scripting notes.
- 🪟 **Windows** notes and customisation references.
- 🎓 **Qualifications & badges** (e.g., Open University, TryHackMe, Cisco) with links to relevant study notes.
- 📚 **Structured learning** tracks (e.g., NCFE L3 units, TryHackMe Cyber Security 101 path) captured as practical notes rather than theory dumps.
