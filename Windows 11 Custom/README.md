# Windows 11 Customization Documentation

This repository documents the changes, tweaks, and configurations Iâ€™ve applied to a multi-user Windows 11 setup. It includes taskbar, login screen, and system registry modifications, along with the scripts and methods I used to manage settings across all accounts.

## Contents

- Taskbar widgets removal  
- Taskbar search bar customization  
- Login screen ad removal  
- Per-user and system-wide registry changes  
- PowerShell scripts to apply settings for all users  

## Purpose

This repository is **purely a documentation of my personal setup and troubleshooting process**. It is not intended as a guide or recommendation for others, as results may vary and some steps require administrative privileges.

## Notes

- Scripts and registry changes were tested on my own system.  
- Some changes involve editing HKCU, HKLM, and NTUSER.DAT.  
- Always backup your system and registry before attempting similar changes.
