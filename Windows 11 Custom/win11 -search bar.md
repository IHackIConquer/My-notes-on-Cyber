## Overview

This session focused on:

- Disabling taskbar widgets for all users  
- Hiding the taskbar search bar while keeping **Win-key search** functional  
- Removing Microsoft 365 login screen text ads - **Still need to do that!** 
- Understanding Windows registry hives and per-user settings  

The work involved **PowerShell scripting**, **Registry edits**, and **Group Policy configuration**.

---

## Taskbar Widgets Removal

**Goal:** Disable widgets across all accounts.  

**Steps:**

1. Open **Local Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`).  
2. Navigate to:  

User Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Widgets

3. Set **Allow widgets** to **Disabled**.  

**Outcome:** Widgets were successfully removed for all accounts. ✅  

**New Skill Learned:** Using Group Policy Editor for the first time.

---

## Taskbar Search Bar Removal

**Goal:** Hide the taskbar search bar for all accounts while preserving Win-key search.  

**Challenges:**

- Initial PowerShell scripts only worked for some accounts.  
- Registry values in **HKCU** (per-user) override machine-wide settings.  
- Locked NTUSER.DAT files prevented edits for logged-in users.  

**Final Approach:**

- Admin PowerShell script iterated over all user folders:  
- Loaded each user’s `NTUSER.DAT` temporarily  
- Created/updated `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search` keys:  
 ```text
 SearchboxTaskbarMode = 0
 SearchboxTaskbarModeCache = 1
 ```
- Removed any per-user `DisableSearch` policy if present  
- Default user hive was patched so **future accounts** inherit the setting  

**Outcome:**  
- Taskbar search hidden for all existing accounts  
- Win-key search functional  
- Future accounts inherit hidden search bar  

**New Skills Learned:**  
- PowerShell scripting for registry edits  
- Understanding HKCU vs HKU vs NTUSER.DAT  
- Handling locked registry hives and access permissions  

---

## Login Screen Ads Removal

**Goal:** Remove Microsoft 365 text ads from the login screen.  

**Steps:**

1. Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit`) — first time using it.  
2. Navigate to:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CloudContent

3. Create/modify these values:  
- `DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures = 1`  
- `DisableSoftLanding = 1`  

**Outcome:** Login screen ads removed across all accounts. ✅  

**New Skill Learned:** Editing system-wide registry keys safely.  

---

## Registry and User Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|------------|
| **SID** | Security Identifier; unique ID for each Windows account. |
| **HKCU** | HKEY_CURRENT_USER; the currently logged-in user’s registry hive. |
| **HKU** | HKEY_USERS; contains all user SIDs and their registry hives, even if the user isn’t logged in. |
| **NTUSER.DAT** | File storing a user’s personal registry settings (HKCU). |

**Key Insight:** System-wide settings (`HKLM`) can be overridden by per-user settings (`HKCU`). PowerShell scripts must carefully handle per-user hives to ensure changes apply for all accounts.  

---

## Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

- Enumerated `SearchboxTaskbarMode` and `SearchboxTaskbarModeCache` for all users.  
- Observed some NTUSER.DAT files were locked or access was denied for Default user.  
- Script successfully patched existing users; Default user patch sometimes failed due to system protection but does not affect current accounts.  

---

## Key Learnings

- How to use **Registry Editor** and **Group Policy Editor** for the first time.  
- The relationship between **HKCU**, **HKU**, and **NTUSER.DAT**.  
- How per-user registry settings can override system-wide defaults.  
- Safe PowerShell scripting for multiple users, including handling locked hives.  
- Importance of testing scripts and checking which accounts were successfully patched.

## User Verification Table

| User Account | SearchboxTaskbarMode | SearchboxTaskbarModeCache | Status                  |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| admin       | 0                  | 1                         | Patched ✅             |
| user1       | 0                  | 1                         | Patched ✅             |
| user2       | 0                  | 1                         | Patched ✅             |
| user3       | 0                  | 1                         | Patched ✅             |
| default     | 0                  | 1                         | Patched for new accounts ✅ |

## Final PowerShell Script

```powershell
# Run as Administrator

# Ensure HKU PSDrive exists
if (-not (Get-PSDrive -Name HKU -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
 New-PSDrive -Name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_USERS | Out-Null
}

$usersPath = 'C:\Users'
$skipUsers = @('Default','Default User','Public','All Users')  # system folders to skip

function Patch-UserHive($ntuserPath, $userName) {
 if (-Not (Test-Path $ntuserPath)) { 
     Write-Warning "NTUSER.DAT not found for $userName, skipping."
     return
 }

 $hiveName = "TempHive_$userName"
 Write-Output "`nProcessing user: $userName"

 $load = reg.exe load "HKU\$hiveName" "$ntuserPath"
 if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
     try {
         $searchKey = "HKU:\$hiveName\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search"
         New-Item -Path "HKU:\$hiveName\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion" -Name 'Search' -Force | Out-Null

         New-ItemProperty -Path $searchKey -Name 'SearchboxTaskbarMode' -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force | Out-Null
         New-ItemProperty -Path $searchKey -Name 'SearchboxTaskbarModeCache' -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force | Out-Null
         Write-Output "Set SearchboxTaskbarMode=0 and SearchboxTaskbarModeCache=1"

         $policyPath = "HKU:\$hiveName\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search"
         if (Test-Path $policyPath) {
             Remove-ItemProperty -Path $policyPath -Name 'DisableSearch' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
             Write-Output "Removed per-user DisableSearch policy (if present)"
         }
     } catch {
         Write-Warning ("Failed to update " + $userName + ": " + $_)
     } finally {
         reg.exe unload "HKU\$hiveName" | Out-Null
     }
 } else {
     Write-Warning "Could not load NTUSER.DAT for $userName"
 }
}

# Patch all existing users
foreach ($user in Get-ChildItem $usersPath | Where-Object { $_.PSIsContainer -and $skipUsers -notcontains $_.Name }) {
 $ntuser = "$($user.FullName)\NTUSER.DAT"
 Patch-UserHive $ntuser $user.Name
}

# Patch the Default user for new accounts
$defaultNt = 'C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT'
Patch-UserHive $defaultNt 'Default'

Write-Output "`nDone. Existing accounts and future accounts will now have hidden taskbar search and functional Win-key search."
```

Important Note

At the end of the session, it is not entirely clear which exact step finally resolved the taskbar search issue. Some accounts showed success despite prior errors.
