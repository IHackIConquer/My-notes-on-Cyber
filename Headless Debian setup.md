# ACER Headless Debian Setup & Notes

Some random notes from messing around with my headless Debian box (an old Acer machine). Mostly just things I had to learn the hard way.

## Disclosure
This write-up (including this disclosure) was reformatted by chat GPT for GitHub Markdown readability:
- Added **headings** and a **table of contents** for navigation.  
- Cleaned up formatting (code blocks, bullet points, spacing).  
- Did minimal proofreading for grammar/clarity, but kept the original casual tone.  
- No technical details were changed â€” all commands, outputs, and observations remain as originally written.

## Getting Started

- Debian didnâ€™t have `sudo` out of the box, so I had to learn to use `su`.  
  Installed sudo with:  
  ```bash
  apt install sudo
  ```

- Learned how to reboot from the command line:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start reboot.target
  ```

- Added my user to the sudo group:  
  ```bash
  sudo adduser casper sudo
  ```

- Installed curl:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install curl
  ```

---

## Jellyfin Setup

- Installed Jellyfin using the repoâ€™s script:  
  ```bash
  curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash
  ```

- Jellyfin was missing a dependency (`libicu`), so I had to install it manually.

- Learned that `ifconfig` isnâ€™t available by default â†’ used `ip address` instead.

- Tried to start Jellyfin by typing `jellyfin`.  
  Correct way is:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start jellyfin
  ```

---

## Terminal Quality-of-Life

- Installed tmux so I could scroll in the terminal:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install tmux
  ```
  - Scroll mode: `Ctrl + b` then `[` â†’ use arrow keys.  

- Alternative:  
  ```bash
  command | less
  ```
  Exit with `q`.

---

## Firewall & Networking

- Decided to try out UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):  
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw allow 8086
  ```
  âœ… Did this successfully.

- Connected from my Kali laptop â†’ Acer headless via SSH.

- Learned how to view live connections using `ss` on both machines.  
  Noted peer address as `56820`.

---

## External USB HDD (1TB)

- Plugged in the drive and used `lsblk` to identify it.

- Created mount point + mounted it:  
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /mnt/usb
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
  ```

- Realized no NTFS support by default â†’ installed `ntfs-3g`:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ntfs-3g
  sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
  ```

- Drive mounted successfully ðŸŽ‰

## Experiment: Playing a Movie Over SSH

- Tried streaming a movie from the Acer box to my laptop via SSH + VLC:  
  ```bash
  ssh user@LT2 "cat /path/to/movie.mp4" | vlc -
  ```

- Failed at first because VLC wasnâ€™t installed â†’  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install vlc
  ```

- Path with spaces was a pain (quotes didnâ€™t help). Eventually tested with a different AVI file that worked.

- Managed to get **sound only**, no video. VLC threw a codec error.  

---

## Next Steps / Things To Try
- Fix the VLC codec issue so I get video, not just audio.
- Clean up how I mount drives (maybe set up auto-mounts).
- Harden SSH + firewall rules.
- Properly configure Jellyfin and stream media over the network instead of hacking it with `ssh | vlc`.
