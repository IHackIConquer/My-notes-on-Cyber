Comments
Sometimes, the code can be very lengthy. In this scenario, the code might confuse you when you look at it after some time or share it with somebody. An easy way to resolve this problem is to use comments in different parts of the code. A comment is a sentence that we write in our code just for the sake of our understanding. It is written with a # sign followed by a space and the sentence you need to write. For example, let’s rewrite the script we discussed in the conditional statements section and add comments to it.

# Defining the Interpreter
#!/bin/bash

# Asking the user to enter a value.
echo "Please enter your name first:"

# Storing the user input value in a variable.
read name

# Checking if the name the user entered is equal to our required name.
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then

# If it equals the required name, the following line will be displayed.
echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"

# Defining the sentence to be displayed if the condition fails.
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi
